This folder contains source code for a model of RNG based on the
supervisory system, and implemented within a system based loosely on
COGENT.

To build the program, use "make" from the unix prompt. This shoudl create two
exectuables: rng and xrng

rng is the basic standalone generation program. Everything is compiled
in and you will need to check the main() routine in rng.c to see how
it is configured.

xrng provides an X interface to the rng program. It required GTK+
(version 2), which is now deprecated.

There are a bunhc of other executable programs that can be made by the
makefile. These are for scanning the parameter space and generating
model fits.
